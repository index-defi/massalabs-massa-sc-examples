# Decentralized blog

This is a sample that shows how Massa's decentralized web can be used to create a decentralised blog platform.

It is not intended as a production quality blog platform.

## Smart-contract (backend)

- [`smart-contract.ts`](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-examples/blob/main/blog/smart-contract/src/smart-contract.ts) contains the smart-contract logic of the blog.

## Front

- [`html`](https://github.com/massalabs/massa-sc-examples/tree/main/blog/html) contains the front.
